## An-Interactive-Photo-Gallery
 
This is an interactive photo gallery using jQuery and Plugins.

jQuery is used to apply a search list that loops through images, depending on user input if the description matches the image it will show it and hide those who don't.

A Lightbox Plugin is used when the user clicks on a thumbnail, the photo will display in a lightbox with back and previous arrows to cycle through photos.

Photos and layout adjust for a mobile-friendly experience.
